This is grammar for a C++ parser, probably intended for OCaml output
(I haven't tested C++ output). As far as I know, it does not do
anything, and may not even work, but it can be compiled with `ocamlopt
-I .. occ2.ml`, provided you have run `make` in `..` and elkhound
exists in `../..`.

Scott McPeak is presumed to have written it, but his intentions for it
are unknown.
