Current Conventions
-------------------

### Convenience Aliases - used to reduce verbosity

- `string` aliases `std::string`,
- `string_view` aliases `nonstd::string_view` or `std::string_view`,
  if the latter is available.
  
### Deprecated Aliases

- `rostring` aliases `std::string const &`. This is being migrated
  to `string_view` generally, and explicit `string const &` where about
  C string is needed within a class

### Good Practices

1. `string_view` is the default way of passing strings as arguments.
   
   It is passed *by value*!

2. `string` is passed by const-reference *only where C strings are
  required* inside the function. Otherwise use `string-view`.
  
  If a `std::string` is available, that instance will be used; or a
  fresh copy will be made at the call site, typically from `const char *`
  or `string_view`. The compiler deals with that.
  
3. A `string_view` can be returned from a function in the following
   two cases:
   
   1. It is a sub-view of a `string_view` passed as an argument, or
   
   2. It is a sub-view of a string whose value is held by the class.
      
      If the class returns the view of an entire `string`, it's best
      to return `string const &` instead.
      
   Using `string_view` as a return value requires care in the 2nd case.
   It is always a good idea in the 1st case, since that has minimal
   overhead and doesn't create unnecessary string copies.

### Future Directions

The goal is to use `fmt::format` or `std::format` if the latter is
available.

Sub-goals are:

- Removal of the stream-like appending operators that are defined 
  for `std::string` in `str.h`.
  
  Those are non-standard and can be  quite confusing, since no one
  expects them. `fmt::format`, on the  other hand, makes formatting
  explicit and offers a lot of flexibility. This work has been done
  and will be rebased and committed soon.

- Removal of printf-like formatting and the printf-like wrappers in
  `str.h`.

- Use of some sort of light template mechanism for generating output
  files from various tools.
  
  Currently, the tools generate output C++ and Caml files in an
  ad-hoc manner. This makes it harder to reason about what the output
  is, and where to modify things to change it.
  
  It'd also allow the end-user to modify the templates to an extent,
  without needing to rebuild the tools.


`str.h` and `strutil.h` will be merged once `str.h` sheds the
"string streaming" operators and perhaps other cruft.

Historical Note
---------------

This is not relevant anymore, as the modern directions differ. See
above.

My general approach had been to use parameters of type 'char const *'
whenever a function was (1) not going to modify the string, and (2)
not going to let the pointer escape (say, into the heap).  This worked
well because it was both efficient and convenient; code that needed to
store strings used 'string' and code that needed to temporarily use a
string used 'char const *', and both could be passed to C library
functions.

But since std::string cannot be implicitly converted to char const *,
this strategy will not work, as it would require lots of explicit
conversions (calls to c_str) that would clutter up the code.

The main alternative is to push 'string' into interfaces further down
in the subsystem hierarchy, closer to the C library.  The main problem
with that is it entails either making the parameter types be 'string',
which incurs an extra pair of calls to malloc and free each time it is
passed down, or make the type 'string const &', which is unwieldy.

Actually, many implementations of std::string, including the one in
gcc's C++ library, use a copy-on-write strategy that would avoid the
calls to malloc and free.  But the price is a significant storage
overhead for each string (4 extra words for gcc), plus potential
problems in multithreaded code.  While in general I think
copy-on-write is a good idea, I do not want to adopt a style of code
that will force me to use copy-on-write to get decent performance.
Moreover, the cost I am *really* concerned about is allocations when
there previously were none; the gap between 1 allocation and 2 is
small compared to the gap between 0 and 1; and copy-and-write is of
no help for eliminating that first allocation.


My (straightforward) idea is to use the following 'rostring':

  // str.h
  typedef string const &rostring;

This type, normally used as a function parameter type, conveys both
(1) that the user promises not to modify the string, and also
(2) that the address of the object passed will *not* "escape", i.e.
be stored in the heap or a global after the function returns.  These
semantics have always been associated with my use of 'char const *'
in parameters, but now they have their own name, and this name is
much easier to type than 'string const &'.

I think this approach provides a reasonable compromise.  It lets
me pass strings down efficiently and soundly, and I can create
string objects implicitly from char ptrs.  The only problem is
I cannot implicitly convert *to* char ptrs, so some conversion
is necessary.

It is my hope that the conversion can be done in such a way that it
would be possible to change the definition of 'rostring' *back* to
'char const *', without breaking too much stuff.  The reason I want
that property is to give me a path to undo the changes, or perhaps use
yet another definition for 'rostring', should that become necessary.
It is also consistent with the limited intended purposes of
'rostring'.


Transition guide for new string interface:

  - Replace non-performance-critical uses of
      char const *
    as function parameters with
      rostring
    which is a typedef for 'string const &'.

    What is performance critical?  Mainly, uses of strings as keys
    in hash tables.  In that case, the string data is often coming
    from a lexer, which must *not* be required to allocate a copy
    just to talk to the hash table.

    Non-performance-critical uses include debugging info, error
    messages, etc.

    If an interface is both performance-critical and also heavily
    used with constructed strings (obviously not on the same code
    paths), then it is reasonable to overload the function to
    accept both 'char const *' and 'rostring'.  However, I do not
    want to do this for lots of functions; generally, any given
    interface should either be classified as above or below the
    boundary line between 'rostring' and 'char const *', and all
    its functions should consistently use one or the other (with
    only well-motivated exceptions).

    See also the discussion below.

  - Be careful when converting code to use 'rostring':
    - It is usually *not* a good idea to change the types of local
      variables to 'rostring'.
    - It will certainly not work to change 'char const *&' to
      'rostring&', since the latter will be an invalid type.
    - Watch out for return types; if the function is returning a
      locally-constructed string, a return type of 'rostring' will
      be death.
    - If the 'char const *' was *nullable*, then you should not
      convert it to rostring, since the latter cannot accept a NULL
      pointer.  One solution is to overload the function to accept
      either a nullable 'char const *' or an rostring.  Another is
      to change call sites (or default args) to pass "" instead.

  - To convert an rostring to a char const*, use
      char const *toCStr(rostring s);
    instead of
      char const *string::c_str() const;
    to maintain the vague hope that 'rostring' could at some point
    be yet some other type (perhaps even 'char const *' again).
    For example:

      void foo(rostring s)
      {
        FILE *fp = fopen(toCStr(s), "r");       // yes
        FILE *fp = fopen(s.c_str(), "r");       // no
        ...
      }

  - One exception to the above: if an 'rostring' is being converted
    to 'char const *' because the former is a parameter of an overloaded
    function that just calls into another version which accepts the
    latter, then use c_str() instead.  This makes it clear that the
    'rostring' is really being treated as 'string const &', not simply
    "something vaguely similar to char const *".  For example:

      int foo(char const *s);                        // real function
      int foo(rostring s) { return foo(s.c_str()); } // yes
      int foo(rostring s) { return foo(toCStr(s)); } // no

  - To convert a string (other than 'rostring') to a char const*, use
      char const *string::c_str() const;
    instead of
      char const *string::pcharc() const;
    as the latter is gratuitously nonstandard and has been deleted.

  - Replace uses of
      string::string(char const *src, int length);
    with
      string substring(char const *p, int n);
    since the former has different semantics in smbase than in std.

  - The old string class allowed code to create a string with
      string::string(int length)
    and then modify the string with
      char *pchar();
    and
      char operator[] (int i) const;
    If the latter function (operator[]) is all that is needed,
    use stringBuilder instead.  If the former is needed, use
    Array<char> instead, but remember to explicitly allocate
    one extra byte for the NUL terminator.

  - To convert code that iteratively scans a 'char const *', such as
      void foo(char const *src)
      {
        while (*src) {
          // ... do work ...
          src++;
        }
      }
    use something like the following:
      void foo(rostring origSrc)
      {
        char const *src = toCStr(origSrc);

        while (*src) {
          // ... do work ...
          src++;
        }
      }
    Rename the *parameter*, and bind a local variable to the pointer
    under the original name, so preserve semantic equivalence.

  - If the code is testing a previously 'char const *' value against
    NULL, e.g.
      if (name) { ... }
    then, assuming the caller has been appropriately modified to
    pass an empty ("") rostring instead, change the test to
      if (name[0]) { ... }
    as this is a little less verbose than name.empty(), and will
    work even if name is changed back to 'char const *'.



The question arises as to exactly where the line should be drawn
between code that nominally uses 'rostring' and code that nominally
uses 'char const *'.  As with most issues of language/API design, it
is a matter of balancing convenience and performance.

Basically, there are three sources of strings in a typical program:

  - Static strings in the program text.

    The transition to 'rostring' may cause some static strings to
    be malloc'd where they were not malloc'd before.  However, there
    are very few such strings (generally less than 10000), so if
    malloc'ing such strings ever becomes a performance problem it
    must be that some strings are being malloc'd multiple times.
    But that is easy to fix, e.g., by changing

      foo("hi there")

    to

      static const string hi_there("hi there");
      foo(hi_there)

    unwieldy though it may be.  (This should not be needed often.)

  - Constructed strings.

    Constructing strings, like

      stringc << "hello" << ' ' << "world!"

    requires lots of allocation, and the result is a 'string'.
    Passing this to an 'rostring' won't incur any penalty.

  - Strings in program input data.

    These are the strings I am worried about.  In the 'char const *'
    regime, these strings are typically first read into an I/O
    buffer first.  From there, the strings are either processed
    in-place and discarded, or else copied to a more permanent
    storage location, but not copied again.

    It would be very bad for performance if the transition to
    'rostring' caused processing of such strings (and there are
    lots of them) to incur additional allocation.  That is why I
    want to keep string table interfaces (etc.) capable of accepting
    raw 'char const *' pointers: it ought to be possible to do all
    the processing on input data strings without them taking any
    trips through the allocator.

So the principles I advocate are:

  (1) Make sure input data strings don't have to make extra trips
      through the allocator.  This means exposing interfaces capable
      of accepting 'char const *' in key places like hash tables.

  (2) Make sure static strings and constructed strings can be used
      as conveniently as possible; for the latter, that means accepting
      'rostring' in most places.

  (3) Avoid polluting interfaces with duplicates interfaces just to
      meet (1) and (2); clutter is a big long-term problem.

One more thing I have been doing is if the interface did not have any
reason to #include str.h under the old 'char const *' regime, for
example autofile.h, then it may be best to stick with 'char const *'
in the interest of minimizing dependencies.  (This is debatable.)
